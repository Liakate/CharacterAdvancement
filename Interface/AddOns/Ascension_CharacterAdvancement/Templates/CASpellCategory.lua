-- GUIDE: What is this file?
-- Purpose: Behavior for a reusable UI widget (a 'template') used by the Character Advancement screens.
--
-- How to read this (no programming experience needed):
-- - Lines starting with '--' are comments meant for humans. The game ignores them.
-- - A 'function' is a named set of steps. Other parts of the UI can call it.
-- - Names with ':' (example: MyFrame:OnLoad) mean the steps belong to a specific UI element.
-- - This addon is event-driven: the game calls certain functions when something happens (open window, click button, etc.).
--
-- Safe edits for non-programmers:
-- - Text near the top (labels, descriptions) is usually safe to change.
-- - Avoid renaming functions unless you also update every place they are referenced.

CASpellCategoryMixin = CreateFromMixins(ThreeSliceMixin)

-- DOC: CASpellCategoryMixin:OnLoad
-- What this does: Sets up this UI element: prepares data, connects events, and sets initial visuals.
-- When it runs: Runs once when this UI element is created/loaded.
-- Inputs:
--   - self: the UI object this function belongs to
-- Output: Nothing (it mainly updates state and/or the UI).
-- What it changes: updates UI/state.
